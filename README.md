Install AutoGPT4All.
Open AutoGPT4All and enter your localhost GPT-4 API key.
Type or paste your prompt into the text box.
Click the "Generate" button.
AutoGPT4All will generate text and display it in the text box.
You can then save the text to a file or copy and paste it into another application.
Requirements:

Python 3.6 or higher
Localhost GPT-4 API key

Installation:

To install AutoGPT4All, simply run the following command:

pip install autogpt4all

Usage:

To use AutoGPT4All with a localhost init of GPT-4, you need to start the GPT-4 server before running AutoGPT4All.

To start the GPT-4 server, run the following command:

gpt4 serve

Once the GPT-4 server is running, you can open AutoGPT4All and enter your localhost GPT-4 API key.

Examples:

Here are a few examples of how to use AutoGPT4All with a localhost init of GPT-4:

# Generate a poem about a cat:
autogpt4all "Write a poem about a cat."

# Generate a code snippet to calculate the factorial of a number:
autogpt4all "Write a code snippet to calculate the factorial of a number in Python."

# Generate a blog post about the benefits of using AutoGPT4All:
autogpt4all "Write a blog post about the benefits of using AutoGPT4All."

Here is a README file for a localhost init of GPT-4:

GPT-4 Localhost Init
This README file provides instructions on how to set up and run a localhost init of GPT-4.

Requirements:

Python 3.6 or higher
GPT-4 model files
GPU (optional, but recommended for better performance)
Installation:

To install a localhost init of GPT-4, follow these steps:

Download the GPT-4 model files from the OpenAI website.
Create a new Python environment and install the following dependencies:
pip install torch transformers datasets
Clone the AutoGPT4All repository:
git clone https://github.com/autogpt4all/autogpt4all
Install AutoGPT4All:
cd autogpt4all
pip install .
Usage:

To run a localhost init of GPT-4, follow these steps:

Additional notes:

If you are using a GPU, you can set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable to specify which GPU to use. For example, to use GPU 0, you would set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0.
You can also set the GPT4_SERVER_URL environment variable to specify the URL of the GPT-4 server. This is useful if you are running the GPT-4 server on a different machine. For example, to run the GPT-4 server on machine 192.168.1.100, you would set GPT4_SERVER_URL=http://192.168.1.100:8000.

To make a local llm autogpt4all vx0.x, you need to:

Download the AutoGPT4All source code from GitHub.
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/autogpt4all/autogpt4all
Create a new Python environment and install the AutoGPT4All dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the local llm autogpt4all vx0.x model.
This can be done using the following command:

python train.py --model_name_or_path gpt4-vx0.x
This will train the model using the GPT-4 vx0.x model files.

Once the model is trained, you can start the AutoGPT4All server:
python server.py --model_path /path/to/model.pt
This will start the AutoGPT4All server on port 8000.

You can then access the AutoGPT4All server from your browser at http://localhost:8000.
Once you have access to the AutoGPT4All server, you can start generating text by typing or pasting your prompt into the text box and clicking the "Generate" button.

Here is an example of how to generate text using the local llm autogpt4all vx0.x model:

# Generate a poem about a cat:
autogpt4all "Write a poem about a cat."

# Generate a code snippet to calculate the factorial of a number:
autogpt4all "Write a code snippet to calculate the factorial of a number in Python."

# Generate a blog post about the benefits of using AutoGPT4All:
autogpt4all "Write a blog post about the benefits of using AutoGPT4All."
